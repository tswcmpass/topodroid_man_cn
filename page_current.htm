<h4>ACTIVE STATION</h4>

The "active" station is the station from which the survey will continue.
If you have set the "active" station, TopoDroid will continue numbering stations from it.
If the "active" station is not set, the last one is used.<br><p>

Thus you can start a branch in the middle of the survey by selecting the station you want to attach as "active" station.
Alternatively, you can replace the FROM station of the first shot of the branch, afterwards.<br><p>

The "active" station is highlighted green in the <u>Survey Data window</u> and in the <u>Drawing window</u>.
A long tap on another station switches the "active" station to that.
A long tap on the "active" station itself turns it off.

The "active" station can be set in three ways
<ul>
<li>with a long tap on the station name in the <u>Survey Data window</u>.</li>
<li>from the <i>Saved stations</i> dialog (button <i>Active"</i>)</li>
<li>through the <i>Station edit</i> dialog in the <u>Drawing window</u>.</li>
</ul>
