<h4>Bric4 CALIBRATION</h4>

The Bric4 calibration is done on-board.<br>
There are two calibration procedures for the orientation: 
a complete calibration, and a quick calibration that updates the correction of the magnetic sensor values.<br><p>

<b>Complete calibration</b><br>

The complete calibration requires to acquire four data at different roll in several directions
(at least 14), covering
all possible orientations.<br><p>

Go to <i>Menu</i>, <i>Calibration</i>, <i>CAL: Full INC&amp;AZM</i>.<br>
A message with instructions appears. Press any button to continue.<br>
The display shows status and group distribution while performing the calibration.<br>
Take four shots for each point rotating the device about 90 degrees around the laser direction.<br>
Four dots show the number of shots taken for the group.<br>
The markings in two horizontal bars show where the distribution of the completed groups magnetic and
accelerometric values. Cursors under the bars show the position for the group that is being taken.<br><p>
<ul>
<li>The device automatically detects when a new group is started</li>
<li>If fewer than four shot are taken the group is not saved</li>
<li>If more than four data are taken, only the last four are used</li>
<li>It is possible to <i>Reset</i> the current group and restart it</li>
</ul>
When 14 groups are taken the <i>Done</i> key appears. Pressing it starts the computation of the calibration.
More groups can be taken before computing the calibration.<br>
After the computation of the calibration a report is displayed.<br><p>
 
 
<b>Quick azimuth calibration</b><br>

Go to <i>Menu</i>, <i>Calibration</i>, <i>CAL: Quick AZM</i>.<br>
A message with instructions appears. Press any button to continue.<br>
A grid with a cross-hair is displayed.<br>
The device must take samples of the sensor values that cover all directions.<br>
Turn the device slowly around in every direction. When the device need to take a sample the
backlight turns off and sampling for that point begins. When the sample is taken there is
a beep.<br>
When the grid is full the calibration computation begins and a report is displayed.<br><p>

Note. The calibration can be interrupted at any time by pressing <i>Abort</i>.<br><p>


<b>Distance calibration</b><br>

Go to <i>Menu</i>, <i>Calibration</i>, <i>CAL: Rangefinder</i>.<br>
A message with instructions appears. Press any button to continue.<br>
Place a target at a specified distance of 1 m, or 3 ft, from a station point. The distance must be measured with
an accurate instrument.<br>
Take four shots and ensure their values are equal.<br>
Press <i>Done</i>. A calibration report is displayed.<br>
