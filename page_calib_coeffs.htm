<h4>DistoX CALIBRATION COEFFICIENTS</h4>

This dialog displays the 24 coefficients of the calibration linear transformations for the <b>G</b> and the <b>M</b> vectors (12 coefficients each) and 3 coefficients of the non-linear terms (only DistoX2 v. 2.3 or higher).<br><p>

It is used in three different situations:
<ul>
<li>The <i>Read</i> button of the <u>Device window</u> display the coefficients read from the DistoX.</li>
<li>The <i>Read</i> button of the <u>Calibration Info window</u> displays the coefficients stored in the database</li>
<li>The <i>Compute</i> button of the <u>Calibration Data window</u> displays the computed coefficients</li>
</ul>

In the last case the dialog displays also an histogram of the residual errors of the calibration data,
the average error (and the "delta" of the original algorithm), the standard deviation of the error distribution,
the maximum error, and the number of iterations taken by the calibration computation.<br>
Assuming that the azimuth-clino error distribution is normal, the standard deviation of the errors should be slightly over half the average value.<br><p>

The error of a calibration data is the angle between the data direction and the average direction of the group the data belongs to, after having taken the calibration correction into account. The errors are reported in degrees.<br><p>

The histogram has ticks on the horizontal axis at 0.5&deg; (yellow line), 1.0&deg; (red line), and 1.5&deg;.<br>
On the vertical axis the tick marks are 10 and 20.<br><p>

The "delta" of the original algorithm is the square-root average of the residual differences between calibrated G-M vectors and the vectors that satisfy the minimization condition.
It gives an estimate of the calibration accuracy (precision of the instrument):
"delta" is roughly 5/4 of the accuracy in degrees.<br><p>

The dialog displays also the magnetic dip [degrees] computed by the calibration algorithm.<br><p>

This dialog has a button to <b>write</b> the coefficients to the DistoX.<br>
A warning is given if the data direction distribution is below 95%, or the calibration average error is above 0.5&deg;.
