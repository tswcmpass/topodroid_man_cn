<h3>3D SKETCHING</h3>

3D sketching is done around one leg at a time.
Therefore the display is centered about the selected leg.
<br><p>

The 3D <u>Sketch window</u> has three modes (and three different button bars):
<ul>
<li>move</li>
<li>draw</li>
<li>select (only for the "leg" view)</li>
</ul>

As for the 2D <u>Drawing window</u>, the leftmost green buttons indicate the current mode.<br>
The other buttons for the <i>move</i> mode are:
<ul>
<li>display mode</li>
<li>notes</li>
<li>walls</li>
<li>refresh</li>
</ul>


In the <i>draw</i> mode you can trace contour lines.
The contour line of the "leg" view lie in the 3D plane dipping with the leg.
Those of section views lie in the section plane.<br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li>undo</li>
<li>redo</li>
</ul>

The <i>erase</i> mode has buttons
<ul>
<li>undo</li>
<li>redo</li>
<li>eraser size</li>
</ul><br><p>

For the <i>select</i> mode:
<ul>
<li>selection mode: either contour/section points or neighbor stations</li>
<li>select size</li>
<li>delete</li>
<li>open: either section or neighbor "leg" view</li>
<lI>clear selection</li>
</ul><br>

The "leg" view contains also the connected legs.
Tapping one of neighbor stations moves the "leg" view to the leg of that station.<br><p>

A section can be created when two points on two contour lines have been selected.
The section plane can be "vertical" or "horizntal".
If it is vertical it contains the two selected points, and the Y-axis is the vertical.
If it is horizontal it passes through their midpoint and the Y-axis is the leg azimuth.
The two points (or their projections) are shown in the display.<br>
A menu commutes between the "vertical" and the "horizontal" choices.<br><p>

When the canvas displays a x-section the "select" button turns into "back" button.
A tap closes the x-section and goes back to the leg view.<br><p>

A x-section can be reopened by 
selecting the point of the x-section (midpoint between the two x-section base points)
ant tappint the "open" button.
