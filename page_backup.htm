<h4>SKETCH RELOAD</h4>

This window is opened by the <u>Reload</u> menu of the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

TopoDroid maintains backup copies of sketch files, from which the sketch can be recovered.<br>
TopoDroid keeps a set of backup copies for each sketch file.
These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and so on. They are stored in the 
<i>tdr</i> subdirectory (binary sketch files). Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated
(eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"),
the old "tdr" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "tdr" file.
<br><p>

A sketch is saved whenever it is closed, or you toggle between plan and profile view, or open a x-section,
or switch to another sketch.
<br>
It is also saved whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased)
while it is open. Upon a modification a timer is started and when it expires the sketch is saved.
The wait-time is a setting (default 60 seconds).
<br>
The number of backups is another setting.
<br><p>

The <u>Sketch Backup</u> window displays a preview of the sketch backups.
One backup at a time is displayed. Some info about the backup are shown in the title: 
<ul>
<li>how long ago it was written, with suffixes for minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), months (M) and years (Y)</li>
<li>size of the file, in square brackets, in bytes</li>
<li>backup number</li>
</ul>
<br><p> 

There are two buttons to move back and forth in the backup list <img src="btn_multiselection_previous.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="36" height="36"><img src="btn_multiselection_next.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="36" height="36"> and one <img src="btn_backup_reload.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="36" height="36"> to return to reload the backed-up sketch and close the <u>Sketch Backup</u> window.
<br><p>

The menus are
<ul>
<li><i>Close</i> the window without reloading the sketch from a backup</li>
<!-- <li><i>Reload</i> the sketch from the displayed backup (and close the window)</li> -->
<li><i>Help</i></li>
</ul><br><p>
