<h3>[1] INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4>Activity levels</h4>
The TopoDroid interface has activity levels, differing by the number of actions that are enabled.
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li>At the <b>basic</b> level [B] drawing is limited to lines, with no editing actions.</li>
<li>The <b>normal</b> level [N] contains all the functions for a detailed cave survey.</li>
<li>The <b>advanced</b> level [A] has also advanced functions.</li>
<li>The <b>expert</b> level [E] has all the functions.</li>
<li>The <b>tester</b> level [T] is only for testing. It has untested features that are partly debugged and may crash the app.</li>
<li>Features at <b>developer</b> level [D] are enabled only in debug build of the app.</li>
</ul><br>

By default TopoDroid has only the <b>normal</b> functions enabled, but you can switch level,
according to your needs, without exiting from the program.
This manual describes the complete TopoDroid.
Features at a level above "basic" are (usually) marked with the level initial, [N], [A], [E], or [T].<br><p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
TopoDroid has a <u>Main window</u> from which you can move to other app activities.  The main activities are:
<ul style="margin-top=0">
<li><b>Survey</b> data management (<u>Survey Info</u> and <u>Survey Data</u> windows).</li>
<li><b>Sketch</b> drafting, <u>Drawing window</u>, is a sub-activity of the Survey activity.</li>
<li><b>3D viewer</b>.</li>
<li><b>Device</b> functions, <u>Device window</u></li>
<li><b>Calibration</b> of DistoX (<u>Calibration Info</u> and <u>Calibration Data</u> windows) is a sub-activity of the Device activity.</li>
<li><b>Cave projects</b>.</li>
</ul><br>

TopoDroid windows have a scrollable button bar at the top, for the most frequent actions, and a menu button at the top-right.
Dialogs usually have a confirmation button (<i>OK</i> or <i>Save</i>).
If there are both, <i>OK</i> saves the input data and closes the dialog, while <i>Save</i> saves the input data and keep the dialog open for a new input.<br>
Dialogs can have also a <i>back</i> (or <i>cancel</i>) button. If not present, the Android <i>BACK</i> button saves the changes and closes the dialog.
Otherwise it just closes the dialog.<br><p>


<h4>Help and user manual</h4>
TopoDroid windows have a menu button (three vertical dots) at the top-right. The last menu opens a quick help about the actions of the window buttons and menus.
The quick-help dialog has a "book" button at the top-right which opens the user manual at the relevant page.
A long tap on the icon opens the manual at the first page.<br>
If your Android has a <i>Menu</i> key, you can use also that to open the man page.<br>
<br><p>

For the dialogs the hardware <i>Volume Up</i> key opens the <i>User Manual</i> at the relevant page.
If your Android has a <i>Menu</i> key, you can use that as well.<br>
For the dialogs with the row of the action buttons of a slightly darker color, the man page can be opened by a long tap
on that row.<br><p>


<h4>Settings</h4>
TopoDroid has a large number of settings.
These are divided in categories and subcategories:
<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Import/Export</li>
<li>Survey data</li>
<li>Sketching</li>
<li>Devices and calibration</li>
<li>3D viewer</li>
<!-- li>Cave projects</li -->
</ul><p>

The settings displayed in the <u>Preferences window</u> depend on the activity level.<br><p>

Numerical settings can have minimum and maximum values. 
If the entered value is outside the bounds, the value of the bound is assigned to the setting.<br><p>

The app settings can be exported to "settings.txt", in plain text format. 
The file is stored in the app private Files folder.
The settings can be later reset importing the values from this file.<br><p>


<div style="font-size: 90%">
More esoteric settings (<a href="page_geek.htm">Geek</a>) are marked with [G].
They are collected under the <i>Custom settings</i> section.
</div>
<br><p>


<h4>Text and Buttons size</h4>
The "Text Size" setting specifies the dimension of the list text entries, in particular the list of surveys, that of shots, and that of calibration data.<br>
There are five choices for the size of buttons: "small", "normal", "medium", "large", and "huge". The "normal" size is suitable for cell phones (5" screen), and is the default. The "large" size is for tablets (7" screen).<br><p>

<h4>Drawing tools (palette)</h4>
TopoDroid comes with a considerable number of drawing tools bundled in.
By default only the most basic tools are enabled. 
You can enable more tools as the need arises, with the <i>palette</i> button on the <u>Main window</u>.
By this means you can get used to the TopoDroid "iconography" a bit at a time.
<br><p>

Additional drawing tool sets can be installed in the palette [G].
Custom tools can be also created and added to the palette, and tools with no use can be removed.<br><p>
