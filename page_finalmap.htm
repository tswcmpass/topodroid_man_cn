<h4>THE FINAL MAP</h4>

This section describes the use of <i>Therion</i> or <i>cSurvey</i> to draft the final map.<br><p>

<b>Therion</b><br>
If you want to compile the <i>Therion</i> project you must supply a <i>thconfig</i> file which can be as simple as<br>
<code>
   source my_survey.th
<br>
   export map -proj plan -o my_cave_p.pdf 
<br>
   export map -proj extended -o my_cave_s.pdf
</code><br><p>

You need to have exported the survey data as Therion ".th" file, and the survey sketches as Therion ".th2" files.<br>
The data file contains commands to input sketch files. However they are commented and you need uncomment them.<br>
The data file contains commands to define a map for each sketch (scrap). For simple surveys you can leave these commented.<br><p>

Alternatively you can export the sketches as Therion ".xvi" files and retrace them using <i>xtherion</i>.<br><p>

<b>cSurvey</b><br>
Export the sketch as cSurvey ".csx" file.<br>
Open the exported file with <i>cSurvey</i>: you will have the data sheet filled with survey data and the sketches properly aligned in the drawing canvas of <i>cSurvey</i>.<br><p>
