This window display surveys in plan view, with midline and station names.
<br>
Each survey has a different color. After a while the colors repeat therefore you should display

The size of the station names is equal to that in the <u>Drawing window</u>.
<br>
The view can be panned and zoomed.
A survey can be grabbed (tap on a station: it gets circled) and dragged around while the other surveys do not move.
In this way you can overlap stations of different surveys that you want to equate.
When they overlap circle them both by tapping the point: you can then insert the equate between them with the "add equate" button.

<ul style="margin-top:0">
<li><i>Add equate</i>: opens a dialog saying which stations are to be equated. 
In order to manually add an equate between surveys of the cave project, tap the "OK" button".</li>
<li><i>List equates</i> between surveys of the cave  project.</li>
</ul><br><p>
