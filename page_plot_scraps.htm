<h4>SKETCH SCRAPS</h4>

With this dialog you can add a scrap to a sketch or switch among the scraps of a sketch.<br>
It is opened from the <i>Scraps</i> menu of the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

A sketch can be divided in more scraps.<br>
Only one scrap is active at a time, the others are shown only in outline (the walls).<br><p>

The <u>New</u> button add a scrap to the sketch. The newly added scrap becomes the active scrap.<br><p>

With the <u>Next</u> and <u>Prev</u> button you can switch to another scrap, to work on that.<br>
These buttons are greyed out when the active scrap is the last or the first, respectively.<br><p>

The <i>Back</i> button closes the dialog without doing anything.<br><p>
