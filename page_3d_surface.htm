<h4>3D VIEWER - Surface DEM</h4>

A surface DEM (Digital Elevation Model) can be shown if it is enclosed in the model file (eg, in a lox file), 
or has been added to the model.<br><p>

The <i>Surface</i> button of the <u>3D Viewer window</u> toggles the DEM display on and off.<br><p>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Surface</i> menu of the <u>3D Viewer window</u>.<br><p>
It is used to load a DEM, a surface texture to overlay on the DEM, and adjust its opacity.<br>
 
It contains
<ul>
<li>a button to select a DEM file</li>
<li>a button to select a texture file, if the model has a DEM</li>
<li>a slider to adjust the opacity</li>
<li>a checkbox to activate the display of the projection of the model on the DEM</li>
<li>a checkbox to activate the display of the surface texture (if there is one)</li>
</ul><br>

<b>DEM file</b><br>

The 3D viewer supports DEM file in ascii format, or Therion grid format.<br><p>

<b>Texture file</b><br>

The 3D viewer supports texture GeoTIFF image files, and OSM map files.<br><p>

The DEM and texture X-Y coordinates must be in the Coordinate Reference System of the model,
because the 3D viewer does not perform coordinate conversions.<br><p>

OSM files are in WGS84 geographical coordinates. The values can be used with models
in UTM cartographic, but the conversion is approximate.<br><p>
