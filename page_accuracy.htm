<h4>SHOT ACCURACY</h4>

Together with each shot, the DistoX2 records and transmits also the values of the intensity of the magnetic field (arbitrary units), that of the gravitational field (arbitrary units), and the dip angle, that is the angle the magnetic field makes with the horizontal plane.<br><p>

By comparing these values with their average values TopoDroid can detect whether a shot might be affected by some anomaly, and should therefore be redone. These unreliable shots are displayed with a red background.<br><p>

The amount these values can differ from their averages before the shot is declared unreliable are specified by the accuracy settings.<br><p>

<b>Note</b> When surveying in an area with magnetic anomaly, the anomaly analysis based on the magnetic field is not valid.<br><p>

<h4>Accuracy settings</h4>

<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<li><i>Acceleration</i>: percent difference of the acceleration from its mean value, above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
<li><i>Magnetic</i>: percent difference of the magnetic field from its mean value, above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2)</li>
<li><i>Dip angle</i>: difference of the magnetic dip from its mean value, above which a shot is signalled anomalous (only DistoX2) [units degrees]</li>
<li><i>Sibling threshold</i>: percent difference of leg values to identify two legs as "bad" siblings</li> 
</ul>
<br><p>

<b>Sibling</b><br>
Siblings are legs with same stations.<br>
In principle the leg between two stations can be measured two or more times, even backwards,
in particular if one measure foresight and backsight.
