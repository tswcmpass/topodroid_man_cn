<h3>[14] CAVE PROJECTS MANAGER</h3>

This window is accessed from the <i>Projects</i> button of the <i>Main Window</i>.<br><p>

A cave project aggregates surveys that are in the TopoDroid database.
The "cave projects" are stored in Therion-like files in the "thconfig" folder of TopoDroid.
A project file is saved whenever the project is closed.
Projects can be exported as Therion or Survex files; exports are saved in the "th" and "svx" folders,
respectively.


The Project Manager displays the list of cave projects in the "thconfig" folder.
The project list is empty if you have not created any project yet.
