<h4>MANUAL DATA INPUT</h4>

If you do not have a bluetooth device you can still enter the shot data manually. 
The <i>Add</i> button opens the dialog for the shot data input. 
You must enter the station names and the shot data (length, azimuth, and clino).
<!-- The <i>reverse</i> button swaps the stations, ie, reverse the shot. -->
<br><p>

If only the backward fields are filled in (the forward fields are left empty)
the shot is entered with the backward data.<br><p>

To add a splay shot enter "." (period) or "-" (dash) in the TO station.
LRUD can be added to a splay shot, thus providing additional splay shots.
In this case the LRUD refer to the FROM station.<br><p>

There is a warning if, upon editing a leg shot, it differs from another leg between the same stations more than one fourth in length, or 15&deg;.<br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> inserts the shot into the survey, and updates the station names incrementing them so that
the dialog is ready to input the next shot</li>
<li><b>OK</b> inserts the shot in the survey, and closes the dialog.</li>
</ul><br><p>

<b>Using Android for the direction</b><br>
Azimuth and clino can be set using the Android sensors [G]:<br>
<img src="btn_compass.png" width="36" border="1" > the reference axis is the direction of the long side of the device.
A timer (10 s by default) lets you point the device before measuring.<br>
<img src="btn_photo.png" width="36" border="1" > the reference axis is the normal to the display: 
look at the TO station on the screen and start the timer when the station is in the
middle of the cross-hair.<br>
A warning is shown if the sensor accuracy is low or there is a sensor failure.<br><p>

<b>LRUD</b><br>
If LRUD are specified the respective splay shots are also inserted.
Additionally you can select whether these refer to the FROM station (default) or to the TO station.<br><p>

If the shot clino is smaller than the <i>Leg WENS threshold</i> setting, the LRUD are in a vertical plane:
U is upwards, D downwards, L horizontal to the left of the shot (i.e., with azimuth that of the shot minus 90&deg;),
and R horizontal to the right of the shot.<br><p>

If the shot clino is greater than the <i>Leg WENS threshold</i> setting, the LRUD are in a horizontal plane:
L is west, R is east, U is north, and D is south.<br><p>

<b>Units</b><br>
Data must be entered in the current units.
For example if the length units are "feet", distances must be entered in "feet".<br><p>

<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Diving mode</b><br>
In diving mode the shot data are depth, azimuth, and distance.
The azimuth is assumed taken with a normal compass, with graduation increasing clockwise.
The azimuth entries are converted as if taken with a caving (geological) compass.
For example an entry of 340&deg; is converted to 20&deg;.
