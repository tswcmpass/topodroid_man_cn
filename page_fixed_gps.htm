<h4>GNSS GEO-POINT</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>GNSS</i> button of the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Geo-points</a> window.<br><p>
  
To use the GNSS the Android "Location" service must be enabled.
For security reasons a generic app, like TopoDroid, cannot enable the GNSS.
If it is not enabled, TopoDroid shows a dialog asking whether you want do enable it (through the "Settings" app).
Remember to disable it when you are done, to save battery life.

While searching for satellites the "GNSS" button becomes red (or green) displays the number of satellites in sight.
When enough satellites are in view the button becomes green and the coordinates are displayed underneath.
You should wait until the coordinate values are stable and the location accuracy is shown.
Then stop the GNSS location tapping the "GNSS" button again.<br><p>

The reported accuracy depends on the phone hardware and the environment.<br>
On Android before API-26 only the horizontal accuracy is displayed.
On Android API-26 and later both the horizontal and the vertical accuracy are displayed.<br><p>
