<ul>
<li><b>reset</b> the Bric4 last time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second)</li>
<li><b>clear</b> the Bric4 memory</li>
</ul><br><p>

<b>Bric4 Last Time</b><br>
After resetting the Bric4 last time the device will resend all the stored data more recent than
the "last time".<br>
TopoDroid will refuse to reset to a time in the future.
<br><p>

The fields of the last-time are shown above the "Reset" button.<br><p>

The minutes and seconds of the Android time are shown on the right below the last-time fields
to help set the Bric4 time in agreement with the Android time.<br><p>

<b>Clear Memory</b><br>
Clearing the memory erases all the data from the memory and resets the shot counter to 1.<br>
The old surveys remains on the Bric4 internal sd-card.
